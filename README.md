# Blockchain Poker

__[ WORK IN PROGRESS ]__

This a is small Poker game based on Substrate framework.\
Currently only 1-on-1 games planned. To run the game you have to:

* Go to `node` directory, build project and run `./heads-up.sh`\
  This will launch two nodes, each player uses it's own node.

* Then go to `ui` directory and run `./heads-up.sh`\
  This will launch UI for each node.\
  First player should open `localhost:8000` in browser\
  and the second one should open `localhost:8001`.

Enjoy!
